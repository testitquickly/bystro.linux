====== OBS studio ======

[ @manjaro @install @obs ]

''sudo pacman -S obs-studio''

Или через yay (AUR helper), только НЕ через Pamac (стандартное Add/Remove Software), там будут глюки.

	obs-studio-browser provides OBS Studio with:
		VST 2 plugins, RIST protocol and AJA device support.
		Browser module with the same CEF as official builds.

	obs-studio-tytan652 provides OBS Studio with:
		VST 2 plugins, RIST protocol and AJA device support.
		Browser module with the same CEF as official builds.
		Some quality of life patches and fixes.

	obs-studio-rc provides OBS Studio latest version (including Beta and Release Candidates) with:
