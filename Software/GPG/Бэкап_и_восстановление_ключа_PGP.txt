The following steps will show you how to backup and restore a PGP key using GnuPG, version 2.2.20 to be exact. The backup is electronic, not physical, such as backups created with PaperKey. I recommend also creating a backup key on paper with PaperKey and keeping it in a safe place for an added layer of redundancy. It is expected you are already familiar using GnuPG from the command-line and have an existing installation of GPG with a key pair available to backup.
Backup

===== Determine which key to backup =====

	➜ gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
	/home/pstibbons/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
	-------------------------------
	sec   rsa4096/C8DE632E9A8A0BDD 2020-11-13 [SC]
		  F38915B041F5F1024AF95C30C8DE632E9A8A0BDD
	uid                 [ultimate> Ponder Stibbons [ponder.stibbons@unseen.edu]
	ssb   rsa4096/DBCD8B98F2F9188C 2020-11-13 [E]

	Here there is only one private key for a Ponder Stibbons.

===== Export the private GPG key =====

	➜ gpg -o private.gpg --export-options backup --export-secret-keys ponder.stibbons@unseen.edu

	This invocation places the key in the file private.gpg in the current directory. The export option backup exports all necessary data for GnuPG to restore the key.

	Enter the private key’s passphrase in the [Export Passphrase Prompt> to export the key.
	Passphrase Prompt to Export GPG Key
	Export Passphrase Prompt

	Now place this backup somewhere safe. Ideally, store it only on offline media.

===== Restore =====

	Import the private key.

	➜ gpg --import-options restore --import private.gpg
	gpg: key C8DE632E9A8A0BDD: public key "Ponder Stibbons [ponder.stibbons@unseen.edu]" imported
	gpg: key C8DE632E9A8A0BDD: secret key imported
	gpg: Total number processed: 1
	gpg:               imported: 1
	gpg:       secret keys read: 1
	gpg:   secret keys imported: 1

	This invocation imports the key from the file private.gpg in the current directory. The import option restore imports all necessary data for GnuPG to fully restore the key. The import option keep-ownertrust keeps the owner trust of the key instead of clearing it’s trust value. This saves having to manually set the trust value for the key later.

	Enter the private key’s passphrase in the [Import Passphrase Prompt> to import the key.
	Passphrase Prompt to Import GPG Key
	Import Passphrase Prompt

===== Edit the freshly imported key =====

	➜ gpg --edit-key ponder.stibbons@unseen.edu

===== Enter trust =====
	
	to modify the trust value of the key

	gpg> trust
	sec  rsa4096/C8DE632E9A8A0BDD
		 created: 2020-11-13  expires: never       usage: SC

	Type 5 to trust your keys completely.

	Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
	(by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

	  1 = I don't know or won't say
	  2 = I do NOT trust
	  3 = I trust marginally
	  4 = I trust fully
	  5 = I trust ultimately
	  m = back to the main menu

	Your decision? 5

	Confirm your choice by entering Y.

	Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) y

	sec  rsa4096/C8DE632E9A8A0BDD
		 created: 2020-11-13  expires: never       usage: SC
		 trust: ultimate      validity: unknown
	ssb  rsa4096/DBCD8B98F2F9188C
		 created: 2020-11-13  expires: never       usage: E
	[ unknown> (1). Ponder Stibbons [ponder.stibbons@unseen.edu]
	Please note that the shown key validity is not necessarily correct
	unless you restart the program.

	Use the command quit to exit.

	gpg> quit

===== Conclusion =====

You should now be able to backup and restore your private GPG keys
